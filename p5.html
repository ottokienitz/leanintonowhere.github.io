<p id = "title"> <strong> notes from the impenetrable </strong> </p>

<pre style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">

it’s hard to be
[a] God
on Sunday
or any other day
a wise man
spoke ; live
just the little bits
try to stay
awake ; in other words
an interruption
in revolt against
itself eternal ; or nothing
that impenetrable black
square suspended
in ether another other’s
prayer ; that it may
be impossible
to know the unknow
able or know the know
able twice ; removed
from the self ; as modern
man supposed
should already be
some where else where
heare! that asymptotic dive
so close to Babylon
(nightmare) ; embrace
the differentiation –of
otherness sublime
to know a | l i (v) e
staring Hades in
her Eurydicean face
that sameness
only soothes
in death and there
is nothing
more different –than
me than me than
infinite jest
et tous

i think
a familiar danger
but of // something

else!
