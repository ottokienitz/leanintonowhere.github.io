<pre style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">

the audacity of hope
speaks in organic tongues
tasting of salt and cinnamon

inhaling new optimism in furrows of wheat
furrowed brows and the feats of mankind

lifting voices high while piercing our roots with the veracious liquidity of long lost
rain seeping into our eyes
emulsified lightning bathing in gold that medal of victory on wings

loose tethers and ties
binding boats to broadsides
creaking wharfs timbered seaweed
smelling of brine and homeward bound

stagger forward and fall to the milky ground
press your cheek against the bosom of belief
dignity carved of twisting smokestacks and halcyonarbors alike

intertwined in an embrace of honest love that harbor of America
for what more can be done but all yet left to better and become

to value and be one --

in many and among </pre>
