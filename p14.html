"I will see you @ the protest"

I will shed a blinded eye but not a tear full without the salt in the wound to taste

you at (on) the sidewalk broken and chipping tripping the passerby three blocks in the future one for each of the crooked street corners missing a square

the laws of physics start deteriorating before the sun comes up, they're already down for the count past nightfall and the numbers haven't added up since 3/5ths a waltz or an Eric Dolphy lullaby

the world's been screaming for a minute or two all black and (or) blue in the face all blue all blues pardon the ex-(press-i-on)-perience

at the prote-an station all lined up single file if not for the angels with their wings on the scales (or vice versa)

the metal weighs like scales and b(l)ind like justice -- here or there

draw the curtains and you're scribbling ink already blood on the translucent panes no more a window than a soul tax

see you @tension for the lack of black of pandora's deafen(ing)ed s-cream and other muted tones

resist a- res(pi)t(e) and pit(y) the p(us) a peach too sweet [like rotten meat?]

O-DIE[Or-Does It Explode?]us
