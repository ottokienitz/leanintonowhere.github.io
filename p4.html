<pre style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">

the beauty in the faces
of nonentities
in the late afternoon

hear the resonance
the knowable world
make it so

strange courage
local genius
quickens

depend upon it
besides
again

organic machines
small (large)
made up of words

reaching
the sun still soaking
sugar marvel

where
the shine still broken
grows

lie back on
green cinders
in the wings

spin upon it
make a man
a nothing that he knows 

houses of rooms
unused somewheres
the sweetest centrifuge

remember the descent
a skipping renewal
of new kinds

the whiteness in the unsuspected
shadows shining
denied the awakening

be a patient of him
darling mother
the beauty of me

old changeless
all but anyone
her by I can see

when Icarus fell it was spring
of the year awake
near itself

normal "today"
undeceived
that is to say

of resonance
near truth made
from making

what machine is it
kind and just
no greater significance than any other
