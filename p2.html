<pre style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">

a denouement<br>

a sea whistle<br>

balking at yet another rite of flattery

without another<br>

stoned away<br>

back against the wall

(the trill of a bird song)<br>

the song bird<br>

unclaimed and un-acclaim&eacute;d<br>

never got-gotten-gutted there in the first place

arriving at 

appended to be

plant a cloud on the shore as a mast on a stern rampart of the afternoon sun well tarnished by now knowing the haze of declension 

a warm moth mouth moth again on a bare chest nestled against the fog 

believing to interrupt when necessary but not doing so any longer than

it all yields mortalit&eacute; and a warm latte imprint and a weight of a feather in the morning 

the burning sun mocking geometry

lighter lingers and goodbye eyes 

tantalizing </pre>
